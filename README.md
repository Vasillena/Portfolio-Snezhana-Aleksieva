## ⭐️  Introduction

Welcome to the portfolio page of this talented young designer. Finally had the opportunity to collaborate closely with a designer and to understand why developers and designers hate each other. Kidding, of course 😅. Amazing (and tough) experience, lessons well learned (like 1px to the left means exactly 1.000000px to the left). You can see her awesome work at: https://www.behance.net/snezhana-aleksieva
This project is built with Next.js, Tailwind and Framer motion.
